  Elytro smart-account wallet CLI for agents: multi-chain ERC-4337, 2FA email OTP, spending limits.
  Teaches agents to simulate before send, get user approval on risky steps, and explain outcomes in a
  fixed, user-friendly format (no raw JSON unless asked). Deferred OTP completed with otp submit.
  Use for: accounts, transfers, contract calls, email/security setup. Node >= 24.

# Elytro CLI — Agent Skill

**Purpose:** Operate the Elytro smart account wallet **safely and predictably**.

**Install:** `npm install -g @elytro/cli` (Node ≥ 24)

**Command reference & risk list:** [references/commands.md](references/commands.md)

---

## How to read command output

- Prefer the structured payload: **`success`**, then **`result`** (or **`error`** on failure).
- **To the user:** translate into the fixed phrases in **User-visible outcomes** below. Offer raw JSON only if they ask.
- On failure, use **`error.message`** and any **`error.data`** hints (e.g. `hint`, supported chains)—rephrase in plain language.

---

## Operating rules (short)

1. **Session start:** `elytro update check` — tell the user if an update exists; do not upgrade without consent.
2. **On-chain facts:** use `elytro query`; do not assume balances or chain state.
3. **Risky commands:** require **explicit user OK** before running anything listed in `commands.md` → *Agent: user approval*.
4. **OTP:** if the result indicates email verification is pending, use the **OTP pending** phrase and stop; user runs `otp submit` with the code when ready (see `commands.md`).
5. **Chains:** 1, 10, 42161, 8453, 11155111, 11155420 · amounts in **ETH** · calldata hex with `0x`.
6. **Before normal sends:** account **deployed**, **hook installed**, **email verified** (`security status`). Treat `--no-hook` as exceptional—only with user approval.
7. **Automation:** pass **account alias/address** for `switch`, `tx simulate`, and `tx send` when multiple accounts exist (avoid interactive pickers).
8. **Secrets:** never paste vault keys or API keys back into chat.

## Agent Communication

Keep **one line of status**, then **one line of next step** when useful. Same wording every time.

| Situation | What you tell the user |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Success (generic)** | **Done —** &lt;plain summary of what changed&gt;. **Next:** &lt;optional one action&gt; |
| **Simulated (before send)** | **Preview —** Estimated max cost: &lt;from CLI&gt;. Sponsored: &lt;yes/no&gt;. Account balance: &lt;…&gt;. **Warnings:** &lt;list each, or “none”&gt;. **Please confirm** you want to send this transaction. |
| **Transaction confirmed** | **Sent —** &lt;amount / what&gt; to &lt;short address&gt;. **Tx:** &lt;hash&gt;. **Explorer:** &lt;link if Result had one&gt; |
| **OTP pending** | **Email verification needed —** We’ve sent a code to &lt;masked email&gt;. **When you have the code:** run &lt;paste submitCommand from result&gt; |
| **Blocked (security)** | **Not ready —** 2FA email or hook setup is incomplete. **Next:** &lt;one concrete elytro command&gt; |
| **Failed** | **Couldn’t complete —** &lt;reason in plain English&gt;. **Try:** &lt;one fix&gt; |

### Formats

| Operation | Format |
|-----------|--------|
| Tx sent | `✅ Sent 0.05 ETH to 0xAbc…1234. Tx: 0xdef… Explorer: <url>` |
| Simulated | Short summary from `tx simulate` **result**: include `gas.maxCost`, `sponsored` (yes/no), `balance`, and **every** `warnings[]` line; if no warnings, say so explicitly. |
| Balance | `💰 agent-primary: 0.482 ETH` |
| OTP pending | `🔐 OTP sent to <maskedEmail>. Run: elytro otp submit <id> <code>` (user must paste the code from email). |
| Error | `❌ <description> (code -32xxx). → <fix>` — use `error.data` from stderr when present (`hint`, `supportedChains`, etc.). |

**Principles**: Lead with outcome. Surface explorer links from `result` when present. Map error codes using `references/commands.md`. Flag security gaps (`hookInstalled`, `emailVerified`, limits) before suggesting sends. Show raw JSON only if the user asks.

## Account lifecycle (for advice only)

`create` → `activate` → email + spending limit → **protected** (hook + verified email + limit).

| Safe to send? | Human-facing check |
|:-------------:|-------------------|
| No | “Account not deployed yet.” |
| No | “Account deployed but email not verified for security.” |
| Yes | “Security profile looks ready for sending.” |

---

## First-time setup 

```bash
elytro init
elytro account create -c 11155420 -a agent-primary -e u@x.com -l 100
elytro account activate agent-primary    # confirm with user first (deploy)
elytro security email bind u@x.com       # then OTP flow
elytro security spending-limit 100        # may OTP
elytro security status                   # confirm all green for your policy
```

Before recommending **send:** confirm deployed + security status the user expects + enough balance.

---

## Workflows

**Every send**

1. `tx simulate` — same account, same `--tx` lines, same sponsor flags as the planned send.  
2. Reply using **Preview —** row above; wait for **explicit yes**.  
3. `tx send` with the same arguments.

**Batch:** same number and order of `--tx` on simulate and send.

**Swaps / contract calls:** obtain calldata off-chain, then same simulate → confirm → send.

**Deferred OTP** (email bind, spending-limit, tx send when limit exceeded, 2fa uninstall)
```bash
elytro security email bind u@x.com
# Parse result.otpPending.id, result.otpPending.submitCommand
# User checks email → elytro otp submit <id> <code>
```

## When something goes wrong

Use the human’s language first; see **Error recovery (human)** in [references/commands.md](references/commands.md) for uniform **Try:** lines.
